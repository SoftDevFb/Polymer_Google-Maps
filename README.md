# Introduction to Web Components & Polymer Workshop
Hello Node+JS Interactive! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for coming to our hands-on introduction to Web Components & Polymer!

Please complete the following steps to get started:

Install Git: Mac OSX & Linux Users | Windows Users

Mac OSX & Linux Users:

Install NVM
Follow the instructions in your terminal
Install the latest version of Node: nvm install --lts
Make sure subsequent commands you use use the latest version of Node with NVM: nvm use --lts (this will persist until you close your terminal tab)
Install the Polymer CLI globally: npm install -g polymer-cli

Clone the Polymer Google Maps Codelab (git clone https://github.com/ComcastSamples/polymer-maps.git) to your local directory where you store your code

cd polymer-maps and install the dependencies for that project by running npm install

Clone the wc-toast repo & follow the instructions on https://github.com/ComcastSamples/wc-toast to get the dependencies & repo set up

(optional) Obtain a Google Maps API key and record that somewhere it will be easy to copy from so you can paste it into your code during the workshop. Note Google now requires a Credit Card to register for the Google Maps Platform and obtain a key. If you don't want to do that, we'll also share a temporary key for use during the workshop.
Google Maps build with Polymer 3.0
